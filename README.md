There was a young Malaysian tuk tuk driver who lived in a shoe.  
She had so many children that she ultimately knew what to do;  
She gave them some blood without any bread;  
Then whipped them all soundly and put them to bed.  
When she awoke the next morning to pain in her head.
She realized none of the kids had gone to bed.
She searched and stumbled looking for fire
But then she realized all her children had turned...
To Vampires!
